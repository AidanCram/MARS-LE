Football Simulator

Instructions: audi, blitz, cointoss, defended, fieldgoal, hike, intercep, kickoff, kickreturn, lp, man, mp, pat, punt, puntreturn, run, scoreboard, sp,success, tback, tdown, truck, yardline, and zone.
   The first instruction run should be cointoss as it defines all the registers. It is important to write the instructions the exact way they appear in the Basic Instructions tab in the Help menu, displayed as a ?, except for instructions with $t5 or $t6 as those represent the home and away team. Whichever you decide to be the Home team must precede the other. The instruction immediately after run, blitz, lp, sp, or mp must be succeed or defended to correctly update yardage and down.
